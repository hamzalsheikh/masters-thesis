The client communicates with the scheduler through http, whereas as the
scheduler-trader and trader-trader communication is through grpc.

\subsection{Trading algorithm}

When cluster state breaks a policy, trading is initaited. The trader retrieves
a list of active traders from the regisrty, estimates the amount of resources
needed while abiding to constraints, and sends a contract request to all
participating traders. It then chooses the most favorable trader, approves the
contract, and adds the received virtual node to the local cluster. 

\subsection{Policies}

\lstinputlisting[language=go, firstline=94,
lastline=96]{../multi-cluster-simulator/pkg/trader/trader.go}


We currently implement two Policies:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Wait time: The policy is broken if the average wait time in the cluster
    is above a threshold.
  \item Utilization: The policy is broekn if resource utilization exceeds a
    limit. 
\end{enumerate}

Incoming policies do not have the pluggibility trait. Users dial the knobs for
accepting incoming contracts with respect to the cluster state.
