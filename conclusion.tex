\chapter{Conclusion}

In this thesis, we explored the complexities of multi-cluster environments and
proposed a novel trading mechanism to address the challenges associated with
resource fragmentation, increased costs, and reduced resource utilization. 

Through simulated experiments, we have demonstrated that the mechanism can
improve cluster performance by increasing resource utilization, reducing costs,
and decreasing job wait times. We've also shown that this improvement is
dependendent on careful workload analysis. The trader should be fine-tuned
through rules and policies to accommodate the specificity of the cluster's
workload. 

With an extensible mechanism, trading between clusters can be generalized and
adapted to fit clusters' needs, providing a robust tool in the multi-cluster
space.
