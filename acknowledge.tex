I would like to express my deepest gratitude to my advisor, Prof. Robert Ricci,
for his endless support and guidance. I am a better person and researcher
because of him.

I am also deeply thankful to my family for being the source of my strength and
for their unwavering belief in me. To my friends, thank you for tagging along
and being a constant source of support.
